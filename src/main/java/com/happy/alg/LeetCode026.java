 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
 简单
 Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

 Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

 Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
 Return k.
 Custom Judge:

 The judge will test your solution with the following code:

 int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
 int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

 int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

 assert k == expectedNums.length;
 for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
 assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
 }
 If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.



 Example 1:

 Input: nums = [1,1,2]
 Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
 Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
 It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 Example 2:

 Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
 Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
 Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
 It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).


 Constraints:

 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
 -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
 nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

    /*

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}


Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
 It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.


Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is sorted in ascending order.
